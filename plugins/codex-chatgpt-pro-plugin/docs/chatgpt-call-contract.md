# ChatGPT Call Contract

The product surface is a conversational browser call, not a stateless API. Codex
brings a prompt, session-history digest, repo context, and artifacts; ChatGPT Pro
answers in the website; Codex records what happened and applies the next patch.

Smoke tests stay as health checks. Real work should use `chatgpt-pro call`.
Inside this development repo, `npm run chatgpt:call -- ...` remains an alias.

The intended value of the line is professional-level model collaboration:
architecture decisions, system specs, feature design, research synthesis, risk
analysis, planning across agents/repos, and hard debugging strategy. ChatGPT Pro
should be invited to disagree, ask clarifying questions, propose a different
architecture, and name prerequisite work when that is the right answer. Do not
treat ChatGPT Pro as just a transport smoke-test endpoint.

## Minimal Call

Input:

```json
{
  "prompt": "natural language request",
  "session": {
    "mode": "new | alias",
    "alias": "main"
  },
  "context": {
    "codexHistoryDigest": "markdown",
    "repoContext": "repo-context.md",
    "artifacts": ["receipt.json", "final.png"],
    "uploadFiles": ["repo-context.md", "diff.patch"]
  },
  "options": {
    "intelligence": "Pro",
    "model": "5.5",
    "responseMode": "blocking",
    "timeoutMs": 300000
  }
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "conversationUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/c/...",
  "assistant": "markdown response text",
  "receipt": "receipt.json"
}
```

The implementation should promise only these things:

- choose or create a ChatGPT browser session
- prove the requested alias belongs to the current repo
- acquire the global browser-profile lock before touching the shared profile
- place a well-formed prompt into the real website
- paste small context or upload bulky context
- wait for and extract the newest assistant response
- return receipt artifacts that make the run inspectable

The current release implements only `responseMode: "blocking"`: Codex sends,
waits, reads, records the transcript, then continues. Event/interrupt mode is
reserved for a later API where send can return a run id and response capture
can happen separately.

`chatgpt-pro call` defaults to the live `Pro` intelligence level when available.
Callers may override with `--level`, `--intelligence`, `CHATGPT_LEVEL`, or
`CHATGPT_INTELLIGENCE`. `--no-default-pro` is only for transport debugging.

The canonical call path must not use OS-level mouse or keyboard automation. For
message insertion it should use DOM focus, CDP `Input.insertText`, and a DOM
button click. Run `npm run test:non-interference` before changing this path.

The call path is text-only. It must not use ChatGPT voice, dictation,
microphone, audio capture, or spoken commands.

## Session Rooms

Treat ChatGPT conversations as rooms:

- `main`: default repo collaboration thread
- `debug`: focused failures, traces, and stack output
- `critic`: fresh skeptical review with compressed context only
- `scratch`: disposable prompt/context checks

Use an existing alias when continuity matters. Use a new chat for clean critique,
independent tasks, or health checks. Do not create one tab per call by default.
Aliases are repo-owned. `main` means `main` for the current project, not any
tab or conversation globally named `main`.

Room lifecycle commands:

```bash
chatgpt-pro rooms project
chatgpt-pro rooms list
chatgpt-pro rooms show --alias=main
chatgpt-pro rooms new --alias=critic
chatgpt-pro rooms rebind --alias=spec --conversation-url=https://chatgpt.com/c/...
chatgpt-pro rooms rebind --alias=spec --conversation-url=https://chatgpt.com/c/... --registry-only
chatgpt-pro rooms repair --alias=main
```

`project`, `list`, and `show` are registry-only and do not touch CDP. `new`,
default `rebind`, and `repair` acquire the global browser lock and send no
prompt. `--registry-only` validates the ChatGPT URL shape but records
`roomTargetVerification: not_verified_registry_only` until a live operation
verifies or repairs the target.

Call thread modes:

```bash
chatgpt-pro call --alias main
```

Continue the active repo-owned room.

```bash
chatgpt-pro call --alias critic --fresh
```

Open a new unbound thread. The alias is only a hint for the receipt and
`freshThreads` history; it does not replace the active `critic` room.

```bash
chatgpt-pro call --alias critic --new
```

Open a new thread, send the prompt, and bind `critic` to the resulting thread.
The previous active thread remains in lineage as archived.

```bash
chatgpt-pro call --alias main --rebind-alias --conversation-url https://chatgpt.com/c/...
```

Deliberately point an alias at an already-open conversation and send the prompt.
Prefer `rooms rebind` when you only need to bind room state.

If the human pastes a ChatGPT conversation URL and asks Codex to work from that
thread, bind it deliberately:

```bash
chatgpt-pro rooms rebind --alias=spec --conversation-url=https://chatgpt.com/c/...
chatgpt-pro history export --alias=spec --last=20
chatgpt-pro history export --alias spec
chatgpt-pro history read --path .devspace/chatgpt-history/spec/<run-id>/history.json
```

The history export includes both user and assistant messages visible in the
thread. Use `--last=N` for a recent window or omit it for the all-visible
conversation snapshot. All-visible means every turn currently loaded in the
ChatGPT page DOM; it is not guaranteed account-complete history. Artifacts
record `historyCompleteness.claim`, `loadAllAttempted`,
`absoluteConversationComplete`, and `olderMessagesMayExist`.

For v1, `history export --load-all` returns `mode.unsupported`. Use
`--require-visible-min=N` to fail closed when a caller expects at least N loaded
messages before export.

For multi-agent/multi-repo operation, the posture is:

- one shared logged-in browser profile
- one global browser-profile lock around active browser control
- separate repo-owned aliases for separate agents/tasks/repos
- reuse each alias by default
- use `rooms new` to deliberately move an alias to a clean long-lived thread
- use `--fresh` only for one-off clean rooms

Project state:

- `.devspace/state/chatgpt-project.json`: local pointer with `projectId`,
  `repoRoot`, display name, and canonical registry path
- `git config --local chatgpt-pro.projectId`: git-level identity used by linked
  worktrees
- `~/.chatgpt-pro-codex/projects/<projectId>/chatgpt-sessions.json`: room
  records, lineage, recent runs, and fresh thread records owned by that project

If an alias record has a different `projectId`, the call should fail with
`session.alias_project_mismatch`. The only escape hatch is an explicit
`--rebind-alias`, which records that the alias was deliberately rebound.

Before every alias `call` or `read`, the runner verifies the browser target is
showing the alias's expected ChatGPT conversation URL. If the saved target id is
stale or points at a different conversation, the runner repairs by finding an
already-open target with the expected conversation id or opening that URL.
Receipts expose this as `roomTarget.targetBoundToRoom`.

The live package proof for this contract is:

```bash
npm run live:repo-thread-matrix
```

It creates two fixture git repos plus a linked worktree, sends through separate
repo-owned ChatGPT rooms, verifies same-alias continuation in one repo, verifies
same alias name isolation across separate repos, exports all-visible history
for each bound room, and reads those compiled artifacts back without touching
the browser.

Interactive calls must echo the exact exchange into the Codex thread:

```md
## Message Sent To ChatGPT Pro

...

## Message Received From ChatGPT Pro

...
```

`chatgpt-pro call` prints this block by default. Agents must paste that exact
block into the Codex thread. Do not summarize, paraphrase, trim, or rewrite the
`Message Sent To ChatGPT Pro` or `Message Received From ChatGPT Pro` sections.
Additional commentary may come before or after the exact block, but not inside
it. Machine consumers may set `CHATGPT_THREAD_ECHO=0`.

For attachment calls, the `Message Sent To ChatGPT Pro` block is the exact text
typed into the composer. Uploaded file bodies are not pasted into the Codex
thread; the receipt carries attachment paths, bytes, hashes, and upload
evidence.

Receipts must include:

```json
{
  "threadEcho": {
    "mode": "enabled",
    "stdoutRendered": true,
    "contract": "agent_must_paste_verbatim",
    "enforcement": "stdout_rendered_not_verified",
    "transcriptSha256": "...",
    "sentSha256": "...",
    "receivedSha256": "..."
  }
}
```

Verify the sealed envelope with:

```bash
chatgpt-pro transcript verify --receipt=.devspace/runs/<run-id>/receipt.json
```

The prompt should say whether the call is a continuation or fresh view:

```md
You are in the `main` ChatGPT session. This is a continuation of the repo
implementation thread.
```

or:

```md
This is a fresh review. Do not rely on earlier ChatGPT conversation memory.
Everything relevant is below.
```

## Concurrency

The current release uses one shared logged-in Chrome profile and one global
browser-profile lock:

```text
~/.chatgpt-pro-codex/locks/browser-profile.lock/
```

Only one `chatgpt:call` or `chatgpt:read` may control the profile at a time.
The default is to wait for the lock. `--no-wait` fails immediately with
`lock.busy`; `--lock-timeout-ms` bounds the wait; `--stale-lock-ttl-ms` controls
dead-owner reclaim. Receipts include `owner` and `lock` fields with run id, pid,
repo/project identity, wait time, held time, and stale-lock reclaim status.

The package classifies commands by operation kind:

- `live-browser`: touches CDP or visible ChatGPT state and must route through
  `src/chatgpt-operation.mjs`.
- `registry-read`: reads repo room state only and does not acquire the browser
  lock.
- `project-state-write`: mutates canonical room/project state under the short
  per-project state lock.
- `deterministic-local`: works on files/artifacts only.

`call`, `read`, `history export`, `choices`/`levels`, login checks, and live
health checks are `live-browser` operations.
`status`, `rooms project/list/show`, `context bundle`, `history read`, and
`transcript verify` are not. The deterministic test
`npm run test:operation-boundary` guards this boundary, and
`npm run test:public-concurrency` proves live commands fail with `lock.busy`
while registry reads continue.

`chatgpt-pro status --alias=main` is the package-shell readiness command. It
must not touch CDP by default; it reports project identity, selected room,
latest receipt/transcript, browser lock owner, project-state lock owner, and
model-cache state.

Shared project room state has its own short-held lock:

```text
~/.chatgpt-pro-codex/projects/<projectId>/state.lock/
```

Use this lock only around `chatgpt-sessions.json` read/modify/write sections:
alias bind/rebind, fresh-thread recording, alias recent-run updates, and init.
Do not hold it while waiting for ChatGPT to answer. State writes must be atomic:
write a temp file, fsync, then rename into place. The global browser lock remains
the long-lived lock for live website control.

## Codex History Digest

Do not dump a whole transcript by default. Send a digest first, and attach raw
history only when it matters.

```md
# Codex Session Digest

## Goal
...

## Current State
- ...

## Decisions Already Made
- ...

## Changed Files Since Last ChatGPT Call
- `path`: summary

## Commands / Receipts
- `npm test`: pass/fail plus artifact path

## Open Questions For ChatGPT
- ...

## Available Raw Artifacts
- `codex-session-full.md`
- `repo-context.md`
- `receipt.json`
```

Default rule: paste the digest every time, paste raw recent turns only when they
carry important nuance, and attach raw artifacts behind file paths.

## Context Tiers

Default posture: keep the typed message concise and attach bulky context
deliberately. `chatgpt-pro call` defaults to `--repo-context=auto`: it uploads
a generated `repo-context.md` for prompts that clearly ask for architecture,
planning, review, debugging, repo/package/plugin work, or similar cross-file
reasoning. It skips repo upload for trivial transport checks and when the
caller already supplied `--context-dir`, `--context-file`, or `--upload-file`.
The bundle lives under `.devspace/context-bundles/<id>/`:

- `repo-context.md`: repo structure, LOC, file contents, and source-map tables
- `manifest.json`: machine-readable file and directory records with line ranges
  into `repo-context.md`
- `repo-context.zip`: zip of both artifacts

The bundle command is:

```bash
chatgpt-pro context bundle --name focused
```

The call command accepts repeatable upload flags:

```bash
chatgpt-pro call --alias main --upload-file repo-context.md --upload-file diff.patch --prompt "Review the attached artifacts."
CHATGPT_UPLOAD_FILES="repo-context.md,diff.patch" chatgpt-pro call --alias main --prompt "Review the attached artifacts."
```

Generated repo context modes:

```bash
chatgpt-pro call --alias main --repo-context=auto --prompt "Review the repo architecture."
chatgpt-pro call --alias main --repo-context=upload --prompt "Use the attached repo context."
chatgpt-pro call --alias main --repo-context=inline --prompt "Tiny contexts only."
chatgpt-pro call --alias main --no-repo-context --prompt "No repo context."
```

Paste directly when content is small and central:

- exact question
- session digest
- short diff
- relevant error output
- one or two key excerpts

Upload files when context is useful but too bulky to paste:

- `repo-context.md`
- `codex-session-full.md`
- `test-output.txt`
- `diff.patch`
- screenshots

Use zip only for broad repo inspection, hidden coupling, or architecture review.
Zip bundles must exclude dependencies, browser profiles, build output, caches,
and unrelated binaries.

## Receipts

For `chatgpt-pro call`, receipt data should include:

- CDP endpoint and browser profile
- lock owner, wait time, held time, and stale-lock reclaim status
- session alias, tab id, and conversation URL
- detected account plan, model, and intelligence level
- desired model/intelligence and whether the call defaulted to Pro
- prompt SHA-256 and character count
- response mode
- attachment paths, sizes, hashes, and upload status
- send method and whether a user message appeared
- message anchor proof, including `responseBoundToSentPrompt`
- response SHA-256, character count, and completion detector
- screenshot, snapshot, console, and network artifacts
- stable error code and suggested human action when recoverable
