# ChatGPT Pro Line

**A Codex plugin that gives your agent a direct line to a logged-in ChatGPT Pro session.**

Codex is great at execution. For the hard parts — architecture, system design,
research synthesis, tradeoff calls, gnarly debugging strategy — you sometimes
want a second, stronger brain. ChatGPT Pro Line lets a Codex agent phone that
brain: it drives a real, logged-in **ChatGPT Pro** browser session, attaches
your repo as context, sends a message, reads the answer, and writes a receipt —
**no API key, no password handling, no scraped cookies.**

It's a phone line, not a scraper.

## Demo

## Why

The strongest ChatGPT Pro reasoning isn't exposed on the API — it lives in the
website. So this bridges to the website, deliberately and safely. The human
stays logged in; the automation is text-only and deterministic; and every call
is recorded to disk. You get Pro-level collaboration inside your Codex loop
without handing an agent your credentials.

Use it for high-leverage work — architecture, specs, feature design, research
synthesis, tradeoff review, cross-repo planning, and hard debugging strategy.
Don't spend the line on trivial syntax checks.

## Major features

- **Repo-scoped rooms.** ChatGPT conversations are bound to your git repo as
  named rooms (`main`, `debug`, `critic`, `scratch`). Linked worktrees share a
  repo's rooms; separate repos stay isolated. `main` means *this* repo's main —
  never some other tab.
- **Repo-as-context, in one file.** Generates a repomix-style `repo-context.md`
  monofile (source tree, LOC, file bodies, line-range source map, hashes), blocks
  secret-like paths/content before writing it, and uploads it only after explicit
  confirmation.
- **One persistent, logged-in profile.** A dedicated Chrome profile keeps you
  logged in across calls and exposes CDP on `127.0.0.1:9222` for deterministic
  control.
- **Multi-agent safe.** A global browser-profile lock serializes every call, so
  concurrent Codex agents never collide in the same ChatGPT window. Locks whose
  owner process has exited are reclaimed immediately, even if their last
  heartbeat is recent.
- **Receipts + verbatim thread-echo.** Every call records the exact prompt and
  response (with SHA-256 hashes), selected model/intelligence, lock timing,
  conversation URL, a screenshot, and network/console logs.
- **Visible history export.** Pull a bound room's visible ChatGPT history to
  disk and reread it later without touching the browser — handy for picking up a
  human-started thread.

## Install

As a Codex plugin, from a local checkout:

```bash
npm install
npm run plugin:sync
codex --enable plugins plugin marketplace add "$PWD"
codex --enable plugins plugin add codex-chatgpt-pro-plugin@codex-chatgpt-pro-plugin
```

For source development, run the CLI directly:

```bash
./bin/chatgpt-pro init
./bin/chatgpt-pro doctor --warm    # open the dedicated ChatGPT browser
# complete the visible login if prompted
./bin/chatgpt-pro doctor --live    # verify login, composer, and model state
```

If `doctor --live` reports `auth.login_required` (exit code `20`), finish login
in the visible window and rerun `chatgpt-pro doctor --live`.

The browser profile is deliberately separate from your normal Chrome profile.
Set `CHATGPT_PRO_HOME` to choose that dedicated profile. The runtime refuses the
OS/default Chrome profile. For stable automation on localized systems, prefer:

```bash
CHATGPT_PRO_CHROME_LANG=en-US chatgpt-pro doctor --warm
```

For more launch control:

```bash
CHATGPT_PRO_CHROME_ARGS='["--disable-extensions","--lang=en-US"]' chatgpt-pro doctor --warm
```

## Quick start

```bash
# First call into this repo's main room
chatgpt-pro call --alias=main --confirm-repo-context-upload --prompt="Review this repo's architecture and name the biggest risk."

# Inspect repo room / lock / cache state without touching the browser
chatgpt-pro status --alias=main

# Open a clean, independent critic room and review a file
chatgpt-pro rooms new --alias=critic
chatgpt-pro call --alias=critic --prompt-file=review.md

# Bind a ChatGPT thread you started by hand, then pull its history
chatgpt-pro rooms rebind --alias=spec --conversation-url=https://chatgpt.com/c/...
chatgpt-pro history export --alias=spec --last=20

# Re-point or fix a room's target after drift
chatgpt-pro rooms repair --alias=main
```

Room lifecycle commands (`rooms new`, `rooms rebind`, `rooms repair`, and
`rooms list/show`) are repo-scoped, so the same alias can exist safely in
different repositories.

By default, `call` selects the live **Pro** intelligence level and detects when a
generated `repo-context.md` would help. Generated repo context is secret-scanned
and requires `--confirm-repo-context-upload` or
`CHATGPT_CONFIRM_REPO_CONTEXT_UPLOAD=1` before it can be uploaded or inlined.
Use `--repo-context=off` / `--no-repo-context` or pass explicit scrubbed
`--upload-file` artifacts for narrower calls.

## How it works

```text
Codex agent
   │  chatgpt-pro call --alias=main --prompt="…"
   ▼
chatgpt-pro CLI ──acquire──►  global browser lock        (one agent at a time)
   │
   ▼
dedicated Chrome profile ──CDP──►  chatgpt.com           (you are logged in)
   │  • attach repo-context.md            │  Pro thinks + answers
   │  • type prompt (Input.insertText)    ▼
   └────────────────────────►  read the newest assistant turn (anchored)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                  .devspace/runs/<id>/   receipt.json · transcript.md · final.png
```

The canonical message path is text-only: DOM focus for the composer, CDP
`Input.insertText` for the text, and a DOM button click to send. No OS-level
mouse/keyboard automation, no voice or dictation.

## Safety posture

- **You own the login.** Automation never types a password, OTP, or solves a
  CAPTCHA, and never reads cookies or session storage. If login is needed, it
  stops and asks you.
- **Text-only, no OS automation.** No synthetic OS mouse/keyboard, no voice. A
  `test:non-interference` gate enforces the boundary.
- **No voice fallback.** The sender only clicks strict composer submit controls
  and refuses voice/microphone/dictation UI.
- **One profile, one lock.** A global browser-profile lock means concurrent
  agents serialize cleanly instead of fighting over the window. If a caller dies
  after writing a heartbeat, the next caller treats the dead-owner lock as stale
  and recovers it instead of waiting for the full TTL.
- **Fails closed.** Ambiguous provenance produces a stable error code
  (`auth.login_required`, `lock.busy`, `response.possibly_stale`, …) — never a
  guessed answer.
- **On the record.** The verbatim prompt and response, hashes, a screenshot, and
  network/console logs land in `.devspace/runs/<id>/` for every call.

## Thread echo

Interactive Codex use keeps the exchange in the Codex session log. `call` prints
this block by default — paste it verbatim, don't summarize:

```md
## Message Sent To ChatGPT Pro

...

## Message Received From ChatGPT Pro

...
```

## Command surface

The installed plugin exposes the `chatgpt-pro-line` skill and the `chatgpt-pro`
CLI. Inside this source repo the same behavior is available via `npm run`:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run chrome` / `chrome:headless` / `chrome:debug` | Launch the dedicated ChatGPT browser (visible / headless / verbose) |
| `npm run cdp:smoke` | Verify `/json/version` and `/json/list` |
| `npm run levels:list` / `levels:set -- --level=Pro` | Read or select the live intelligence level |
| `npm run choices:set -- --model=5.4` | Select the live model |
| `npm run rooms:list` | List repo-owned rooms (no CDP) |
| `npm run context:bundle -- --name=focused` | Build the repo-context monofile |
| `npm run chatgpt:call -- --alias=main --message-file=prompt.md` | Source-repo alias for `chatgpt-pro call` |
| `npm run history:export -- --alias=spec --last=20` | Export visible history |
| `npm run plugin:sync` | Refresh the materialized install bundle |

Common runtime switches: `BROWSER_POSTURE=headed|headless`,
`CHATGPT_DEFAULT_LEVEL` (default `Pro`), `CHATGPT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS`
(default `240000`), `CHATGPT_REPO_CONTEXT_MODE=auto|upload|inline|off`,
`CHATGPT_CONFIRM_REPO_CONTEXT_UPLOAD=1`, `CHATGPT_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default
`600000`), `BROWSER_OBSERVER=1` (print a run-inspector URL). See the contract
docs for the full list.

## Tests

```bash
npm run test:v1     # deterministic package gate (no browser, no login)
npm run test:live   # live browser proof suite (needs a logged-in ChatGPT)
```

- `npm test`: runs deterministic tests only — it does not require Chrome or a
  logged-in ChatGPT website session.
- `npm run test:v1` adds the v1 readiness gate on top of the deterministic
  suite.
- `npm run test:plugin-install` proves the materialized plugin installs into a
  fresh Codex home from the local marketplace entry.
- `npm run test:live` drives the real website: doctor, history export, room
  rebind/repair, and the repo/thread isolation matrix.
- Live proof scripts are `live:doctor`, `live:history-export`,
  `live:rooms-rebind`, `live:rooms-repair`, and `live:repo-thread-matrix`.
